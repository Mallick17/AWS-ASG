# Componenets of Auto Scaling Group
### Launch Template Configuration
When setting up an ASG, you start by choosing a launch template, which defines how EC2 instances are configured, like the operating system and instance type. This ensures all instances are consistent, making management easier.

### Instance Launch Options
Next, you configure where instances run, such as the network (VPC and subnets), and choose between On-Demand and Spot instances for cost management. This step ensures high availability by distributing instances across zones.

### Integration with Services
You can optionally integrate with load balancers to distribute traffic and set health checks to replace unhealthy instances, improving reliability. This is key for applications with varying traffic.

### Group Size and Scaling
Set the number of instances (desired, minimum, maximum) and scaling policies, like tracking CPU usage, to automatically adjust capacity. This balances performance and cost during demand changes.

### Notifications and Tags
Optionally, add notifications for events like instance launches and tags for organizing resources. These help monitor activities and manage resources efficiently.

- **Why it's used:** Ensures instances are launched in the correct network environment and are distributed for high availability, mitigating zone failures.
- **How it works:** Selected via dropdowns and checkboxes, with warnings if instance types are unavailable in certain zones (e.g., `t2.micro` not in one zone), prompting adjustments.

## Step 3: Integrate with Other Services

**Component: Load Balancing**
- **What it is:** Option to attach the ASG to an existing load balancer or create a new one (e.g., Application Load Balancer "mallow-1," internal scheme, port 80, target group "mallow-1").
- **Why it's used:** Enhances application scalability and availability by distributing traffic across instances, preventing bottlenecks during spikes.
- **How it works:** Configured via radio buttons, with options for type (e.g., Application Load Balancer), scheme (internal or internet-facing), and listeners (e.g., HTTP on port 80), integrating with target groups for routing.

**Component: VPC Lattice Integration**
- **What it is:** Integration with VPC Lattice for improved networking and service-to-service communication, routing requests to the ASG via target groups.
- **Why it's used:** Facilitates scalable and secure communication between services, enhancing connectivity in complex architectures.
- **How it works:** Selected via radio buttons, with options to attach to an existing service or create a new one, supporting modern application networking needs.

**Component: Health Checks**
- **What it is:** Configuration for monitoring instance health (e.g., EC2, ELB, VPC Lattice, EBS) and replacing unhealthy instances, with a grace period (e.g., 300 seconds).
- **Why it's used:** Maintains application availability by ensuring only healthy instances serve traffic, reducing downtime.
- **How it works:** EC2 checks are always enabled, with optional checks (e.g., ELB, EBS) via checkboxes, and a customizable grace period to allow initialization before health checks.
